# Module 10^9 + 7

- <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/modulo-1097-1000000007/>

In most of the programming competitions, we are required to answer the result in 10^9+7 modulo. The reason behind this is, if problem constraints are large integers, only efficient algorithms can solve them in allowed limited time.
